# Online leaderboards (Firebase on Google Cloud)

Leaderboards work on each device out of the box. To make them global, connect a Firebase project (the free Spark plan is enough).

Data model: `boards/{board}/scores/{uid}` with `{ name, avatar, score, ts, exp }`. Board ids look like `daily-2026-10-12-challenger`, `week-2026-W42-pro`, `g_times_sprint-daily-2026-10-12-pro` and `xp-week-2026-W42-explorer`. Three things write, always to the player's league: the Arena daily round and a Ranked game round (today's and this week's board each), and weekly XP (the `xp-week` board, at most once a minute). See Boards below. Nothing is written for a Player without an Age answer, or under 13 without the Parent step (`canPost()` in `js/cloud.js`, see Privacy). Each anonymous identity has one entry per board, and it only changes when the new score is higher. The browser client is `js/cloud.js`; the config lives in `js/cloud-config.js`.

## One command (recommended)

On a machine with the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) and Node.js, from the repo root:

```
bash cloud/setup.sh
```

It asks for a project id (default `sbmadhav-vedic-math`; or pass it: `bash cloud/setup.sh my-id`) and is safe to re-run. It:

1. Signs you in to `gcloud` and Firebase if needed (a browser window opens for each).
2. Creates the Google Cloud project if missing, enables the APIs and adds Firebase to it.
3. Creates the Firestore database in native mode (location `nam5`; override with `REGION=us-east1`).
4. Turns on Anonymous sign-in and adds `localhost`, `sbmadhav.com` and `www.sbmadhav.com` to the authorized domains (Identity Toolkit admin API).
5. Deploys `firestore.rules` and `firestore.indexes.json` from this folder.
6. Creates a Firebase web app if none exists and writes its config into `js/cloud-config.js`.
7. Turns on the Firestore TTL policy on `exp`, so entries delete themselves about 30 days after the last score.
8. Prints the next steps (commit and push), the App Check steps and a budget alert command.

If step 4 says Authentication is not initialized, open the Authentication page in the Firebase console, click **Get started** once, and run the script again.

## Manual path (Firebase console)

1. In the Firebase console, create a project (or add Firebase to an existing Google Cloud project).
2. Build > Authentication > Get started > Sign-in method: enable **Anonymous**.
3. Build > Firestore Database: create a database in production mode (pick a US location such as `nam5`).
4. Deploy the rules and indexes from this folder: `npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore --project <project-id>` (run inside `cloud`).
5. Project settings > Your apps > add a **Web app**, copy its config object, and paste it into `js/cloud-config.js` (keep the comment at the top):
   `export const FIREBASE = { apiKey: "...", authDomain: "...", projectId: "...", appId: "..." };`
6. Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains: add `sbmadhav.com` (and `www.sbmadhav.com`; `localhost` is there by default).
7. Turn on automatic deletion: Firestore Database > Time-to-live > Create policy, collection group `scores`, timestamp field `exp`. Or: `gcloud firestore fields ttls update exp --collection-group=scores --enable-ttl --project <project-id>`. This needs the Blaze plan; on Spark the command fails with "billing disabled". Keep `parentNote()` in `js/app.js` in step with whether the policy exists.
8. Commit and push `cloud-config.js`.
9. Recommended: App Check (next section) and a budget alert in Google Cloud billing (the script prints the command).

The web config is public by design. Security comes from the rules and App Check (see below).

The browser key (Google Cloud console > APIs & Services > Credentials, "Browser key (auto created by Firebase)") is restricted to the referrers `https://sbmadhav.com/*`, `https://www.sbmadhav.com/*`, `http://localhost/*`, `http://localhost:*/*`, `http://127.0.0.1:*/*` and `https://sbmadhav-vedic-math.firebaseapp.com/*`, and to five APIs: Firestore, Identity Toolkit, Secure Token, App Check and Firebase Installations. Add a referrer there before serving the app from another host.

## What the rules enforce

- Anonymous sign-in is required to write (and to read your own entry), and a player can write only `scores/{their uid}`. Nobody can delete from the browser.
- Fields: exactly `name`, `avatar`, `score`, `ts`, `exp`. The nickname must be `Adjective Noun NN` using the word lists in `js/store.js` (update the rules if those lists change). `ts` must be the server time. `exp` must be 1 to 60 days ahead (the client sends 30).
- Scores: even integers from 10 to a per-league cap (every right answer earns 10 to 30 points, always even). The game has no hard maximum, so the caps assume a fast human pace for 60 seconds: Explorer 2000 (70 right in a row), Challenger 1600 (57), Pro 1200 (44). `MAX_SCORE` in `js/cloud.js` mirrors them.
- Board window: a board accepts writes only while its date (or ISO week) is current somewhere on Earth, plus an hour of slack. Old and future boards are frozen.
- Rate limit: an entry changes only when the score rises and at least 50 seconds after its last write (a round plus countdown is 62 seconds).
- Reads: lists of a valid board need no sign-in but must use `limit(20)` or less, so viewing a World board creates no identity (`docs/adr/0002`). Getting one entry by its id needs that entry's own signed-in identity, so nobody browses entries one by one.

These limits make forging harder and cheaper to absorb; they do not prove a score was earned. App Check closes the main gap: scripts writing directly to Firestore from outside the site.

## App Check (recommended)

App Check makes Firestore accept requests only from this site, using reCAPTCHA. The client wiring is already in `js/cloud.js` and stays off until `appCheckSiteKey` in `js/cloud-config.js` is set.

1. Enable the APIs: `gcloud services enable recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com firebaseappcheck.googleapis.com --project <project-id>`.
2. Firebase console > App Check > Apps: pick the web app and register it with **reCAPTCHA Enterprise**. Create a key for the domains `sbmadhav.com`, `www.sbmadhav.com` and `localhost` (the console can create it for you), and save.
   A classic reCAPTCHA v3 key also works: register with **reCAPTCHA** instead and set `appCheckProvider = 'v3'`.
3. Paste the site key into `appCheckSiteKey` in `js/cloud-config.js`, commit and push. Run `python3 site-build.py` if the service worker caches the page.
4. For local testing, open the site on `localhost`: the console prints an App Check debug token. Add it under App Check > Apps > Manage debug tokens.
5. Leave enforcement off for a few days and watch App Check > APIs > Cloud Firestore. When nearly all requests show as verified, click **Enforce** for Cloud Firestore. Also enforce for Authentication if the console offers it (blocks scripted creation of anonymous accounts).
6. If the page sets a Content Security Policy later, allow `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/`, `https://www.gstatic.com/recaptcha/` and `https://content-firebaseappcheck.googleapis.com`.

When App Check is on, the parent note on the site also mentions that Google reCAPTCHA checks scores come from the site.

## Rules tests

`test/` runs `firestore.rules` against the local Firestore emulator with `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`. Needs Node.js 20+ and Java 11+ (the emulator is a Java program). No Google account or project is used.

```
cd cloud/test
npm install
npm test
```

Board ids in the tests are built from today's date, because past and future boards are frozen. They cover: creating your own entry in every league, writing another player's entry, invalid board ids, past and future boards, nicknames (shape and word lists), avatars, scores (odd, non-integer, below 10, over each league cap), extra or missing fields, a client-set `ts`, `exp` bounds, updates that do not raise the score, partial updates, the 50 second rate limit, deletes, reads of your own entry only, list queries (`limit` 20 or less), signed-out access (top-20 lists of valid boards allowed; bigger, unlimited or invalid-board lists, single-entry gets and every write refused), reads and writes elsewhere, and a top-20 `orderBy('score', 'desc')` query with no composite index. Run them after any change to `firestore.rules`.

## Privacy

- Players are anonymous: no email, name, age or account. The browser client is `js/cloud.js`, and everything it posts goes through `submit()`.
- **Age answer first** (`docs/adr/0001`): nothing is posted for a Player until they answer one neutral age question, asked the first time a Ranked round's score would be posted. The answer is stored only on the device, in that Player's record (`age` in `vm.players`), and is never sent.
- **Parent step for under-13s**: a Player whose Age answer is under 13 posts nothing, in any Mode, until a grown-up turns on World boards for them on this device (Me page: a simple adult check, then the "Allow World boards" switch, stored as `parentOk`, only on the device). A grown-up can switch it off there; posting stops again, and entries already on World boards stay. Until then their Scores and XP rank on Device boards only.
- **No identity until the first post** (`docs/adr/0002`): viewing World boards loads Firestore and App Check only, never Firebase Auth, and reads signed out. The Firebase Anonymous Auth id is created at the Player's first actual post. Firebase Authentication keeps that id with its created and last sign-in dates. After the first post the device keeps a copy of the id (`vm.cloudUid`) to mark its own row on a board. All Players on one device share that id, so they share one entry per board.
- What is posted: the score of an Arena Daily challenge and of a Ranked game round (today's and this week's board for each), and the weekly XP total. XP comes from all play, Practice included, so Practice adds to the posted weekly total; Practice scores themselves never leave the device.
- An entry holds only a generated nickname (from fixed word lists, never typed), one of five avatar colors, an integer score, a server timestamp and an expiry time. The rules reject anything else. The document id is the anonymous id.
- Nothing is sent unless online leaderboards are turned on in `cloud-config.js`, and the Firebase SDK loads only when a World board is opened or something is posted.
- TTL policies need the Blaze (billing) plan, so on Spark entries are not deleted automatically and the parent note says so. Withdrawing the Parent step does not delete entries either. If the project moves to Blaze, set a budget alert, create the TTL policy (step 7), and change `parentNote()` back to promise deletion about 30 days after the last score. Entries cannot be deleted from the browser. To honor a removal request, find the entry by nickname and color in the Firebase console and delete it.
- The site shows a note for grown-ups beside every World board (Arena, each game page, Pro home) and on the Me page. It is `parentNote()` in `js/app.js`; keep it in sync with this section.

## Boards

- **Arena daily race:** `daily-YYYY-MM-DD-<league>` and `week-YYYY-Www-<league>`.
- **Ranked game boards:** `g_<game>-daily-...` and `g_<game>-week-...` for each of the 14 games (game ids use `_`, for example `g_times_sprint`). Scores are difficulty-weighted points, capped at 12000.
- **Weekly XP:** `xp-week-YYYY-Www-<league>`, XP earned this week across everything, capped at 60000.

After changing `firestore.rules`, deploy it with:

```
cd cloud && npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules --project sbmadhav-vedic-math
```
