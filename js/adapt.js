   Every game has one difficulty dial from 1 (a first counting game) to 20 (hard enough for strong adults).
   A right answer turns it up, a miss turns it down, so each player settles where they get about 3 in 4 right.
   Points are weighted by difficulty, so scores compare fairly across players working at different levels.
   The dial each player reaches is saved per game as their rating and becomes their next starting point. */
